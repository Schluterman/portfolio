          <h2>TRANSCRIBED FROM THE JUDSONIA ADVANCE
        
            <br> OCTOBER 24, 1917 P. 1
</h2>
          <p>Ft. Brady, Mich.</p>
          <p>Saulte Ste. Marie is a nice little place, about 20,000 population. It’s awful cold up here now. Colder than it ever gets in Arkansas. The care of the Locks and the International Bridge is in our hands. You would be amazed at the stupendousness of the shipping which passes through the Locks. I was on guard last night and counted 115 ships, anyone of which could carry Judsonia away at one load, then some.
 
You see all the shipping that goes through here is munitions and wheat, there has been one or two attempts to destroy the Locks by German suspects.</p>
 <p>
The Guard is done under the same conditions, in regard to strictness, as if we were at the front. The battalion commander informed us that the punishment for sleeping on post was, to be a target for the firing squad.
 
The 33rd Michigan Regiment of the Militia was here but I guess they couldn’t fill the bill. Anyway they sent’em to the “Sunny South,” to drill and stuck a handful of Regulars in their place to do the hardest bit a soldier can do, walking a lonesome post in the most severe climate on earth. I believe I would as lief be in the first line trenches in France.
 <br>
But I am glad to get out of the recruit class and do some real soldiering.
 
There are a lot of deer up here and Moose too. Am going to get me one before winter is over.</p>

          TRANSCRIBED FROM: BATESVILLE DAILY GUARD
            <br>MARCH 28, 1918, P. 4
            </h2>
          
          <p> I received your telegram yesterday, but my reply would have been too long to send by telegram so I am taking this method of replying.

Justin Gray made application to Gov. Brough for a commission in the 3rd Ark. I referred his application to the Adjt. Genl. And thought sure it would receive favorable consideration, but later I found out that three New York men had been appointed as follows: CHAS. F. GLAENZER, Adjt. For 3rd Ark. JAMES P. QUINN Supply officer for 3rd Ark. JOHANNES HOEBEE, Adjt. 114th Ammunition Train which position he now holds. GLAENZER quit, and has gone back to the Army. The others are still here. There was one more New Yorker that I was about to forget, a swede by the name of Johnson, he also went back to the Army.</p><p>
Mr. Ruddell, I haven’t any idea what you want with this information but I am glad to give it to (PIECE OF PAPER MISSING), in my estimation it was a dry dirty trick and if you want to use it for any purpose to defeat Brough then I am for you and consciously believe you will be doing the state a great favor.

I am strictly for the home man and belive that JUSTIN GRAY is a MUCH BETTER MAN than any of those men from NEW YORK.
Hoping this is the information that you want and wishing for you every success you might wish for yourself.</p>
