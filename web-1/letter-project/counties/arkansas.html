          <h2>TRANSCRIBED FROM THE GRAND PRAIRIE NEWS
            <br> NOVEMBER 7, 1918 P. 3
<br>
Somewhere in France
 
September 20, 1918..</h2>
          <p>Dear Cousin:<br>

I thought I would drop you a few lines to let you know I got the two letters you wrote to Camp Beauregard. They were sent on from there. I sure was glad to get them, too, the first mail in two months.

It has rained for three weeks straight over here, and the mud is a foot deep in some places. There is one good thing about France, the roads are nearly all paved from one town to another and they don’t get very bad. I wish you could see it. It is good to look at as long as you see something new all the time, but when you stay three or four weeks in one place, it gets old.</p>
<p> 
The place I’m where I’m staying now, is owned by an old lady, who thinks that the band boys are “just it,” and every time one of the boys gets sick or even coughs in the night, she gets up and comes out to see what is the matter, and brings some rum and teas, hot brandy or something. She sure is good; sews all our clothes and does everything.

</p> 
          <p>It is awfully hard to write on a baritone case, with an old straight pen. I have lost my fountain pen which makes two I have lost in the last three months.

We got paid off for two months, Sunday, and you should see the boys shoot craps and count this French money.

I have been trying for the last two months to learn French, and am no farther along now than I was before I left the states.
The band went to play a concert for the General the other Sunday. We went to the place in a truck. Some swell place too. An old castle, placed back in the forest, and some swell furnishings. I saw a chandelier in there, that cost $2,000, all the colors you could imagine; also, counterpanes of Japanese silk, all colors, and the most beautiful designs. All furniture far better than I ever saw before. Just out from the castle, about a mile, is an old stone, about twenty five feet high, and there is light running into it from all directions. These little roads lead out to the main road in all different ways, and are arched over with trees; some of them are a mile long, and you can see the other end through the arch. It was the old meeting place of the old hunters, and the stone dates back 400 years.

Well, as I am limited to a small space and a bad place to write, must close.</p>

          <h2>TRANSCRIBED FROM THE DEWITT ENTERPRISE 
            <br>OCTOBER 24, 1918 P. 4
            </h2>
          <p>

I could write on other themes than the one I have chosen, but none other would be a means of attaining my purpose, since it is the boys of the late draft that I wish to reach and also the “folks at home.” It is those boys who will soon be in the service that I wish to address this to in the hope that it may help them in the coming days.

In civil life before entering the service it may be said I was “my own boss” to a great extent. My day’s work was what I cared to make it and my privileges were un-numbered. I was free to indulge in that which was a pleasure i. e: motoring, hunting, picnicking, etc. You know too well the freedom and joy of everyday life of a civilian. Probably you do not know so much about military life. “Hitting the trail” or the army as I have found it is what I wish to convey to you.

The first thing that impressed me as a civilian was the kakai uniform. It is nice to look upon and one admires the wearer and finds himself wanting to wear one, too. The military life looks inviting from without. By this I mean it seems fascinating and very inviting to the civilian. As all boys, I knew I was sometime to be called to “do my bit.” I made up my mind to be a fighter from the first day and to take what came my way with a willing heart. I had thought much about the service but never took it very seriously.<span id="dotss">...</span>
<span id="moree">
<br>
          Now that I am in the army, the “democratic army,” I can tell you more of the life. My first experience was riding in a “special” chaircar that must have had chairs with straight backs for there was no reclining to them and that first night was long, and as tough as long. Upon reaching camp you can expect to be greeted as “rookies” from all sides and “where are your cigarettes?”  “we collect all cigarettes etc;” “hats off and a thousand other crys. Then comes your first night’s sleep on an army bunk of a straw mattress between wool blankets. That night you will have a thousand and one different thoughts and wonder if you will be murdered the coming day. But the coming days bring relief from scares of the “shots” and the drill and soon you find yourself so busy that you have no time for delving into the future and wondering what the coming day will bring, for the present is more than you can handle with three or four officers on your heels. It seems as though the officers care very little for your feelings and you soon are inclined to want to “cuss some of them out,” but for your own benefit I would advise your not doing that. It will seem that it is very unjust to trust you as they do since you have been accustomed to all kinds of personal liberties. It is then that one realizes the job isn’t soft. After being a K.P. (kitchen police) and having had experience in washing dishes, scrubbing floors, waiting tables, doing guard duty, “surgeon detail,” or better known as pulling weeds, and picking up cigarette butts and matches, you will most likely conclude that you have had your dignity stepped upon, but you will find relief when your “pardner” says he quit playing beside Ethel Barrymore, or another one says he quit as a corporation lawyer to join the service. Such incidents are quite common in the C.O.T.S.  (central officers training schools) as well as in other branches of the service.
​<br>
After two months of life in the infantry and radio training, I have completed five weeks in the field artillery officers training school and find that the previous experience records are all broken here in the F. A. C. O. T. S. the first inducement to enter the C.O.T.S. is to gain the gold bars and again we look upon the surface as when first entering the service. After being here some weeks one comes to realize what he has undertaken and then it is that a new initiative is given him. He is training to lead men in battle, a fight between life and death, and he holds the reins of the lives of his men in his own hands to a very large extent. It is then that he cares little for petty disappointments and personal ambition, for he knows he must be a fit man. If we are not fit men for officers we will not be disappointed men, for we would not care to lead men when we are not capable of doing so. The man in the C. O. T. S. jumps from his bunk at 5 a.m. , dresses in 5 minutes, has his breakfast, shines his shoes, cleans the barracks, cleans his clothing, makes his bunk, mops the floors, picks up all cigarette stubs around barracks, shaves, etc, all before 6:30 a.m., when he begins his days drill. The day is spent in drilling, exercises, instruction, etc. at 6 p.m. mess call is blown and after mess study takes place until 9 p.m. at 9:30 p.m. lights are out and then comes the real rest, only to be broken by the bugle in the morning. This routine is repeated day after day and hopes, disappointments, fears, come upon the horizon and fade away. Tonight finds me waiting for Monday and the same old grind.<br>

I am nearing the close of the “transformation” period and feel as though I am at home here now. Soon you will have to face the things I have __ and I want to ask you not to look for a “good thing” but to look for hard service, yes the hardest you have ever faced, and make up your mind to meet the new duties with a determination to do or die and meet them with a willing heart. Be prepared to forget that you ever enjoyed home comforts and expect the worst, even if the best comes your way. Boy, be willing to serve and give all you can and never feel discouraged whatever may happen to you. Make up your mind to take your place and fight, soldier, twenty-four hours per day, and not let the cutting words of an officer make you disgusted or sore, for it is for your good and it is you who will be serving for those at home. I trust that these few lines of the army life as I have found it will be helpful to you and lead you to meet your duty with a cheerful and willing heart.
