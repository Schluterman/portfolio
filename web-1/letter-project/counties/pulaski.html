          <h2>TRANSCRIBED FROM THE ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT
            <br> DECEMBER 3, 1918 P. 4
</h2>
          <p>

Last night there was such a heavy cannonading at the artillery school that one could easily imagine he was at the front. There were probably 15 or 20 batteries firing for several hours steadily and some of them were less than 300 yards from my window, but I have gotten so used to the sound that I pay no more attention to it than to the rattle of the East Ninth street car. It’s no wonder I fell asleep during the midst of it.

Through my window I can hear cheers and cheers of the enlisted men of a nearby regiment celebrating victory in a hotly contested football game. The regiment has just finished its training some time ago and is awaiting orders where to go.

</p> 
          <p>I played baseball yesterday and today my fingers and arms are so sore that I have difficulty in forming the letters when I write.
​
There are two kinds of money here, that which is good all over France and that which is good in a limited locality. Paper money is issued by the Bank of France and other banks just like in the United States, but chambers of commerce in different towns also issue paper money, usually in small denominations—two francs, one franc, one-half and one-fourth franc.</p><p>

I am enclosing some of the metal money issued by and good only in La Rochelle. It is net- htaof about Rochelle. It is one-tenth of a franc, a franc being worth about 18 cents. When one talks about tin money over here one is telling the truth.

With Turkey now out of the war, Austria likewise, and Germany in a bad fix, it looks like there will be little fighting left. While I should like awfully well to haev a part in the fighting, like everyone else, I’d be most pleased if the war would end.
​
How long after that it would take to get us back I do not know, but certainly longer than it took to get us over. </p>

          TRANSCRIBED FROM THE ARKANSAS GAZETTE
            <br>NOVEMBER 10, 1918 P. 40
            </h2>
          
          <p> I was on one of the five American destroyers that had been ordered to stay within the three-mile limit, in the harbor on Manila, condemned as unseaworthy. Later we were ordered to report for duty in the war zone, which meant a hurry-up cruise across the world. We didn’t know where we were going until we were five miles out of Manila bay, when the captains called their crews to quarters and told them, ‘We’re going to war,’ and the men let out a yell.</p>
<p>
We left Manila August 1, 1917, and on October 20, 1917 our log showed 11,008 miles in an actual steaming time of 39 days, 14 hours and 50 minutes, out of a total of 81 days and five hours. We coaled at a number of islands on the way across, touching at British North Borneo, the Nicobar Islands, Bombay, a harbor on the Arabian coast, and Aden, the longest leg of the cruise, a 2,100-mile run between Bombay and Aden being broken by several stops necessitated by the condition of some of our five old tin water snakes. At Bombay we tied up alongside miles of low, black freight sheds in Alexandria dock, and the crews were ordered to stay out of the native quarter because there was bubonic plague about.</p>
<p>
We went up the Red sea, into the Mediterranian, where we got ready for the Hun, our life lines strung in their places, the 4,000-ton mother ship in the center and her five tin water snakes around her. We were near Naples, however, before we sighted a submarine. When the first shot was fired the Hun went under quick. At Naples, the mother ship discharged her cargo of rice and some of the officers went up to Rome. At 9 o’clock on the morning of October 20 we steamed into his majesty’s dockyard at Gibraltar.
