          <h2>TRANSCRIBED FROM THE CARLISLE INDEPENDENT
            <br> DECEMBER 19, 1918 P. 4
<br>
Nov. 14, 1918

Mrs. Dee Fletcher,   
  
Carlisle, Ark,</h2>
          <p>Dear sister:<br>

I am going to write to you this time. I received yours of Oct. 1st on the 12th of this month. Guess I should have gotten it sooner but it had to be sent on. It was the first one mailed to me overseas. I received one from Oscar the day I got yours; he was doing fine, liked his new company fine; said all of the home boys were o.k. You know they are all in the same Bn.
<br>
I like my new company fine and the division I am in has made a good reputation on the front. I celebrated my birthday by going into active service the first time. Was in a couple of times more afterward. You can tell the people there that your brother went over the top twice in this war and came out without a scratch, but some of the boys in the company were not so fortunate. I will tell you all about it when I get home.

</p> 
          <p>I have marched over a good part of the battle grounds of France. Believe me the country is some torn up.

I can’t think of much to write you just now. I am well and get plenty to eat and all the good warm clothes I need so when you get this don’t worry about me any more, the war is practically over and from now on I will make it all right. I will write you pretty often from now on. Give everybody my best regards. I close with lots of love to all of you. </p>

          <h2>TRANSCRIBED FROM THE LOG CABIN DEMOCRAT 
            <br>NOVEMBER 7, 1918 P. 8
            </h2>
          <p>Dear Norma:</p>
          <p> I will now, as I have time, answer your letter. Sure was glad to hear from the dear old States again. I would have answered sooner, but I didn’t have the chance. I am in the hospital now, and I have a chance to write. Well, I will have to stop writing a minute for here comes the nurse with some more medicine.

I don’t stay in the towns much. When we are in the trenches we’re going over the top and then we come back and go to rest billets.</p>


<p>
This sure is a pretty country over here. The French raise grapes and make some fine wine. I don’t like the win, but, oh, the beer–it sure is fine.

Well, I am too weak to finish my letter. Wait til I rest awhile.

As I am feeling better now I will finish my letter. Say, I killed seven “Dutchmen” the first time I went over and the next time three, and they got me. Those Germans are always trying to make their get-a-way, but we are on our watch, you bet.
<br>
Buy liberty bonds and help to drive the Germans back. Every dollar invested in bonds helps us boys over here.
           
It sure looks odd to see so many women wearing black, and mourning. Nearly every family has as many as four in the army.

Say, send me some pictures; just any kind, just so they are from home. They all look good to us boys over here.

Well, I guess I had better close.  You may have this published if you wish.”
