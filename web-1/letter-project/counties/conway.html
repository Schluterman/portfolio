            <br> MARCH 1, 1919 P. 5
<br>
</h2>
          <p>Yes, the war is over, and the active barbarians have for the time being become dormant. No, I did not win the war---it could have been won without me or my assistance, but I functioned as I was instructed, and did all that was possible to promote the German defeat. I saw the plain and open horrors of modern warfare, and it is nothing short of a living h—l, or as nearly so as modern war machines could render it. I saw the big coast artillery guns belching forth tons of high explosive, throwing them in the form of a big shell, 20 miles distant, and when they would fall they would blow a hole into whatever they should strike large enough to place two large boxcars. One shell alone would wreck the entire Donaghey building. Or a good example of their power. Three of them would leave the Marion hotel a pile of ruins.
<br>
On the morning of November 1, when the barrage started, the whole heavens were a solid mass of glittering flashing from the big guns. There were all sizes shooting at the same time. The whole front from Verdun to the North sea was a fine flame and destruction for the Boche, and did not think for a second the Dutch did not retaliate, for they did, and for the first three days it was an awful place for any human being to be. Men were falling in front and all around us, some wounded, some killed. We were passing over German wounded and dead by the score. Our division did not lose nearly as many men as I had thought they would. My own company lost only one man who was struck with shrapnel. It participated in two of the worst battles of the whole front and came out in fine condition.<span id="dotss">...</span>

  I wa snot unnerved at all during this drive, for at St. Mihiel I had passed through the period of mental death, and that makes a man a fatalist. Most every soldier is one, and says, “O, well, if one has my number, it will get me anyway.” A man thinks of his own safety as a secondary consideration, and goes on working as you would see a big bunch of factory employes laboring amid machinery that if a false move were made would tear their life away, and never think anything about it. I saw everything with a grand offensive, such as was launched on that first day of November, and I certainly never want to witness such again as long as I live.
​<br>
The Germans say that the French fought for freedom, the English for the high seas and the Yanks for souvenirs. 

On the 4th of November I was sent back to school at Chattelon Sur Saine, and I sure was glad to get away, too---not that I was afraid of losing my life, but I was tired to death. For four days and nights I had been going, and not one minute’s sleep. I went to bed the minute the lieutenant told us the place belonged to us. It was at 11 o’clock in the morning and I did not awaken until 8 o’clock the next morning. 
<br>
While I was en route from school to my organization, I heard a conversation between one of the negro soldiers and an Algerian (a French negro who wears a French uniform same as a French soldier). The French soldier was doing guard inside a camp at St. Dizier, France, and guarding some German prisoners who were working. Two American negro soldiers walked out of a wine house and looked over and saw the French negro, so one of them walked over and said to him, “Say, niggah; tells me how’d you come to be in dis here French army?” French negro (not understanding) “No com-paw paw.” American negro—“D’ell you don’t! If you didn’t have such a big long bayonet on dat gun, I’d make you tell me de trufe;” thereupon turning to his comrade, saying, “Come over here and see if you can figure dis niggah out, cause I sho’ ain’t got no diplomatic relations wid dat niggah.” They both decided to let him go for the time and get another glass of beer. 
<br>
Well, I will tell you a little of Germany and then close. This is a rough country through here, and there are no farmhouses as you see in the states. All the people live in small towns and have primitive customs. They still plow with oxen and use dogs to pull carts. A woman’s life is valued very low; they seem to be born only for slaves. They work from daylight until dark, and are not appreciated. No one owns a car and a carriage and a horse is a fortune. They say we are spendthrifts, and I sometime agree with them.

          <p>I am with the bunch who helped wipe out the St. Mihiel salient, and am now on another front, giving them h---. I wont say where, for fear of the censor, but papers of current date will tell you. I understand that they are being driven back on all fronts. You people at home hear general news before we do, although we beat you to it on our own front, which, for a regiment or a division, is small when compared with the entire battle front.
<br>
This paper was part of a Hun officer’s memorandum book, and I am using one of their calendar’s placed across my knees as a writing desk. We are temporarily stopping at one of their abandoned headquarters. It will be for a short time only—our next stop will be further toward the Rhine.

Heinie has begun to throw over a few six-inch love tokens, so for fear the mud will be thrown on and spoil this letter I will close. Our guns give him over two to one, and that is why we are pushing them so hard. I’ll bet there is some excitement in the United States about now. Look for us to come home next year.
<br>
At last I have a chance to mail this—from the hospital. No cause for worry, though, for it is only a little puncture of the right shin bone. No bones broken, and I will be after them in a few days.
 
NOTES: Sergeant Edward D. Roberts was writing to his sister, Mrs. E. C. Jones. The last paragraph was written 6 days later. He was born in January 1891 in Morrilton, Conway, Arkansas. He sailed for France on the Von Steuben on May 26, 1918 from Hoboken, New Jersey. He served with Co. C, 8th field Signal Battalion, A.E.F.
